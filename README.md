# Reload Hotbar
Loads any changes made to the `hotbar.nbt` file when the "Saved Hotbars" tab in the creative menu is clicked, or when using the "Load Hotbar Activator" hotkey.  
Changes made in Minecraft (via the "Save Hotbar Activator" hotkey) are automatically saved in vanilla, this mod just modifies loading to work the same.  

Uses the [Fabric launcher](https://fabricmc.net/use/), does not use the Fabric API.
